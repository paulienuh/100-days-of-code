The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 10, Sunday, 2017].

## Log

### R1D1 
I decided to join the challenge after some inspo and motivation from people on Twitter: https://twitter.com/paulienuh/status/906812317995864064

<strong>Overall goal: Understand front-end development more thoroughly, especially Javascript. </strong>

To get started I started the front-end development coding course with freeCodeCamp, I went through the HTML/CSS parts quite easily (from previous experience) but actually learned some new things such as:
<li>shortening of HEX code </li>
<li> overriding CSS with <code>!important</code> </li>
<li>Bootstrap button styles - never used them before!</li>

I also did some editing on my website: http://paulinenarvas.com

This was a great way to get in the coding grind! Excited for the days to come! üòä

### R1D2
Today's coding hour actually lasted for around four hours üòÖ I've been working on a website for the University of Sheffield's Green Impact group, I had a mock up idea that I coded in HTML which took a while to be approved. 

I've been trying to convert the HTML website I made to Wordpress for a while but things slowed down my ability to like wrong passwords for cpanel, working with code 9-5 for 3 weeks demotivated me to code after work etc. But I finally pushed it all out today which is great. It's definitley a burden off my chest!

Completed WP project here: http://www.greenimpact.group.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/

### R1D3
Continued my freeCodeCamp front-end development course. Things I learned:

<li>Some bootstrap classes I didn't know existed like <code>well</code> - I always find it cool finding out more about bootstrap üòä</li>
<li>Practised some jQuery - it's actually quite simple. I never really played around with it until today. </li>
<strong>Notes:</strong>
<li>bling bling bling ‚û°Ô∏è <code>$</code></li>
<li>Change CSS using <code>.css</code></li>
<li>Add CSS class using <code>.addClass</code></li>
<li>Remove CSS class using <code>.removeClass</code></li>

### R1D4
Continued freeCodeCamp and completed the first half of it: basics of HTML, CSS and jQuery. I found jQuery quite easy to pick up and actually was surprised by how easy it actually is!

I also set-up a CodePen account and became familiar with the interface a bit more. I'll definitley be using it more often to showcase some work/test my code.

Some notes on jQuery:
<li> You can remove with jQuery: <code>removeClass</code></li>
<li> You can change CSS: <code>.css</code></li>
<li> You can change the HTML: <code>.html</code></li>
<li> You can remove something entirely: <code>.remove</code></li>
<li> You can move elements using: <code>.amendTo</code></li>
<li> You can clone elements using <code>.clone</code></li>
<li> You can target parent's CSS using <code>.parent().css</code></li>
<li> You can target child elements using: <code>.children</code></li>
<li> You can target specific child elements <code>.target:nth-child(n)</code></li>

Also just begun Javascript with them. üòä

<li>Maths</li>
<li>I managed to convert the temperature celsius to fahrenheit! Woah, JS is so cool? </li>
