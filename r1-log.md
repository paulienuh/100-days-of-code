### R1D1 
I decided to join the challenge after some inspo and motivation from people on Twitter: https://twitter.com/paulienuh/status/906812317995864064

Overall goal: Understand front-end development more thoroughly, especially Javascript. 

To get started I started the front-end development coding course with freeCodeCamp, I went through the HTML/CSS parts quite easily (from previous experience) but actually learned some new things such as shortening of HEX code and overriding CSS with !important. This was a great way to get in the coding grind! ðŸ˜Š
