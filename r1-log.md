## Log

### R1D1 
I decided to join the challenge after some inspo and motivation from people on Twitter: https://twitter.com/paulienuh/status/906812317995864064

<strong>Overall goal: Understand front-end development more thoroughly, especially Javascript. </strong>

To get started I started the front-end development coding course with freeCodeCamp, I went through the HTML/CSS parts quite easily (from previous experience) but actually learned some new things such as:
<li>shortening of HEX code </li>
<li> overriding CSS with <code>!important</code> </li>
<li>Bootstrap button styles - never used them before!</li>

I also did some editing on my website: http://paulinenarvas.com

This was a great way to get in the coding grind! Excited for the days to come! ðŸ˜Š
